# CodeMate Terminal

A secure and monitored terminal environment built with Streamlit. This application provides a web-based terminal interface with system monitoring capabilities and file management features.

## Live Demo

The application will be available at: https://codemate-terminal-streamlit.app (after deployment)

> Note: All files are stored under WORKSPACE_ROOT and the disk storage is ephemeral. Make sure to backup important files.

## Features

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hiiiHimanshu/codemate-terminal.git
cd codemate-terminal
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
export WORKSPACE_ROOT="./workspace"  # On Windows use: set WORKSPACE_ROOT=./workspace
export READONLY_MODE="false"
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud with the following configuration:

- Python version: 3.11
- Environment variables:
  - WORKSPACE_ROOT=/app/workspace
  - READONLY_MODE=false

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Monitoring**: psutil
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## Safety Model

This application implements a multi-layered safety model:

1. **Workspace Jail**: All file operations are confined to a designated workspace root directory
2. **Command Whitelisting**: Only approved commands can be executed in read-only mode
3. **Dangerous Command Blocking**: Commands like `rm`, `sudo`, `curl`, etc. are blocked entirely
4. **Path Validation**: All paths are validated to ensure they don't escape the workspace
5. **Subprocess Sandboxing**: When enabled, subprocesses are executed with security restrictions

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Environment Variables

- `WORKSPACE_ROOT`: Directory that serves as the root for all file operations (default: `./workspace`)
- `READONLY_MODE`: Enable read-only mode to prevent destructive operations (default: `false`)
- `ALLOW_SUBPROCESS`: Enable subprocess execution (default: `false`)

## Deployment (Streamlit Community Cloud)

To deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Set the following secrets in your Streamlit app settings (optional):
   - `WORKSPACE_ROOT`: `/app/workspace` (for Streamlit deployment)
   - `READONLY_MODE`: `true` (recommended for security)
   - `ALLOW_SUBPROCESS`: `false` (recommended for security)

### Deployment Hints

- A default `WORKSPACE_ROOT` directory (`./workspace`) will be created automatically at app startup if it doesn't exist
- Streamlit secrets are not required unless you want to customize the default behavior
- The application will boot without any local state - all state is managed through the workspace directory

### Deploy Checklist

- [ ] Ensure `./workspace` directory exists or will be created automatically
- [ ] Verify app starts successfully with `streamlit run app.py`
- [ ] Test basic commands work without local state
- [ ] Confirm workspace isolation is functioning
- [ ] Validate read-only mode can be enabled via environment variable
- [ ] Check that subprocess execution is disabled by default
- [ ] Test that the healthcheck command shows up in startup logs

## Demo Script Checklist for Judges

- [ ] Start the application with `streamlit run app.py`
- [ ] Verify that the workspace root is set correctly
- [ ] Test basic commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `echo`
- [ ] Test help system with `help` and `help ls`
- [ ] Test command history with `history`
- [ ] Test error handling with invalid commands
- [ ] Test argument validation
- [ ] Demonstrate workspace isolation by attempting to access files outside workspace
- [ ] Demonstrate dangerous command blocking
- [ ] Test read-only mode by setting `READONLY_MODE=true`
- [ ] Show execution timing in command responses
